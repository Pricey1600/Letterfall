# Letterfall
 
**Welcome to the esteemed Letterfall club!**

Come inside and play a round of our original tabletop game! It requires strategy, speed, and a robust vocabulary as you use letter tiles to create words from words of past plays. The longer the word, the more the reward.

Click and drag tiles to create English words. Words can only be used once.

Made for the GJL Game Parade Spring 2025 Game Jam. All assets except the music were created by myself during the 10 day long jam. No AI involved.
